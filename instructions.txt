If you have an existing Spring Boot application and you want to run it, you can follow these steps:

1. Download or Clone the Project:
If you don't already have the project on your local machine, you'll need to download or clone it from a repository (e.g., Git repository).

2. Set Up Your Environment:
Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Spring Boot supports JDK 8 and later versions.
Ensure you have Maven installed.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Spring Boot project.
Build the Application:
If you're using Maven, run:
"mvn clean package"

This will compile your application code and package it into an executable JAR file or a WAR file, depending on your project configuration.

4. Run the Application:
If you've built an executable JAR file, you can run it using:
Copy code
java -jar your-application.jar
If you're using Maven, you can run the application using:
"mvn spring-boot:run"

This will start the embedded Tomcat server (or any other embedded server configured in your project) and deploy your Spring Boot application.

5. Access Your Application:
Once your application has started, you can access it through a web browser or an HTTP client by navigating to the appropriate URL (usually http://localhost:8080, but it may vary depending on your configuration).
